# Quota, pacing and the run record

Internet Archive's limits, how a run paces itself against them, and what each
run writes down about itself.

## `--limit` counts planned targets, not Sheet rows; `--chunk-size` overrides `CHUNK_SIZE`

*Decided 2026-08-22.*

`--limit` is applied to `plan_upload_targets()`'s own output — after it has
already filtered to rows that are valid, ready, and not already done — never
to raw Sheet rows. The real Sheet is ~3,000 rows, the great majority
uncatalogued (see "A blank cell is not an error"); "stop after scanning N
rows" and "stop after uploading N rows" are very different numbers on a Sheet
shaped like that, and only the second is useful to an operator pacing
against the 5,000/day cap. `--limit 100` on a Sheet with 2,900 uncatalogued
rows and 150 ready ones uploads 100 of the 150, never the first 100 read.
It combines with `--chunk-size` as "this many total, batched this way", not
"this many chunks": `--limit 10 --chunk-size 3` uploads 10 items in batches
of 3, never 10 batches of 3.

Targets sliced away by `--limit` cost nothing: `plan_upload_targets` still
mints an identifier for every pending row up front (minting is pure
arithmetic — see its own docstring), but a target `--limit` drops is never
reserved, so its number is never written anywhere and `next_identifiers()`
mints it again on the next run. No permanent identifier is spent on a row
this run chose not to touch.

`--chunk-size` makes `SheetUploadRun.execute()`'s `CHUNK_SIZE` read (a
module constant previously overridable only by hand-editing it, or by
`monkeypatch.setattr("ia_bulk.CHUNK_SIZE", ...)` in a test) an ordinary
per-run flag, defaulting to `CHUNK_SIZE` (500, IA's per-run cap) so every
existing chunk-boundary test keeps working unchanged. The operator had
already been hand-editing the constant to rehearse the reserve/upload/confirm
protocol across a chunk boundary; this makes that a flag instead.

Both flags are Sheet-path only, rejected on `--csv` the same way
`--write-identifier`/`--dry-run` are rejected there: `run_rows()` (the `--csv`
path) has no reserve/confirm batching for `--chunk-size` to control, and no
ready/not-ready distinction for `--limit`'s counting promise to mean
anything. Both are recorded in the `run_header` log record (see
`ARCHITECTURE.md`, "Logging and resume") so a run that stopped at `--limit`,
or used a non-default `--chunk-size`, stays reconstructable from its own log
alone.

## A run is scoped to a batch by value; the column is registry configuration

*Decided 2026-09-06.*

`upload --batch "Logging"` uploads only the rows whose batch column holds
that value, and `validate --batch "Logging"` previews exactly that set. Which
column holds a row's batch is a per-project fact, so it is `batch_column` in
`projects_registry.json` and never a second command-line flag — the same call
made for `--files-dir` and `--collection` (see "Technical configuration lives
in the registry, not the command line"). The command line carries only the
value, which is the part that changes from run to run.

The scope is applied **before anything counts the rows**, so it composes with
`--limit` the way `--limit` already composes with `--chunk-size`: `--batch
"Logging" --limit 100` uploads 100 of the Logging rows, not 100 rows read and
then filtered. For the same reason `upload`'s "N rows not yet catalogued"
line counts only the batch — another batch's uncatalogued rows are not this
run's business to report.

**The scope travels as row numbers, never as a filtered list of rows.**
Everything downstream of the Sheet read is positional: `validate_rows` and
`plan_upload_targets` both number rows `offset + 2`, and several functions
index back with `rows[row_number - 2]`, so a compacted list would silently
renumber every row after the first gap. The sharper hazard is minting.
`plan_upload_targets` deliberately scans **every** row for identifiers
already spent; handed only one batch's rows it would mint numbers another
batch is already holding, and identifiers are permanent. So the full row list
travels the whole way through and the scope narrows only what is planned and
what is reported.

Scope is passed *into* `plan_upload_targets` rather than used to filter its
output, which is the one place this differs from `--limit`. `--limit` slices
a prefix, and a target it drops costs nothing because minting is pure
arithmetic and the number is re-minted next run. A target dropped from the
*middle* is different: `next_identifiers()` takes `max+1` and never refills,
so minting for an out-of-scope row and discarding it would leave a permanent
gap in the sequence. Minting only for rows in scope keeps a batch's numbers
contiguous. Numbering across batches still interleaves, which is fine —
identifiers carry no meaning, and uniqueness per project is what matters.

**Matching folds case and strips surrounding whitespace.** These cells are
typed by hand into a Sheet by several people over months, so `Logging `,
`logging` and `LOGGING` are one batch. The cost is that two themes differing
only in case can never be scoped apart; on a Sheet like this one, a case
difference is far more likely to be a typo than a distinction. A blank cell
never matches: a row nobody has catalogued yet has no batch, and must not
join whichever one happens to be running.

**Four refusals, no fallbacks.** An empty `--batch` value; a project with no
`batch_column`; a `batch_column` naming a column the Sheet does not have; and
a value no row carries. Every one of them is a hard error naming the fix,
because the two failure modes they guard both read as success — an ignored
flag uploads *everything* while looking like a batch run, and an unmatched
value reports "nothing to upload", which is indistinguishable from a batch
that is already finished. The unmatched-value message lists the values
actually present in the column (capped, so a wide column stays readable) so a
typo is visible without going back to the Sheet. The first two need no Sheet
at all and are checked before it is read, so a mistyped flag does not cost a
full read, a full file-resolution pass over the drive and a full validation
first.

`--batch` is Sheet-path only, rejected on `--csv` alongside `--limit` and
`--chunk-size`: a CSV is a small hand-prepared file whose rows are already
the ones the operator chose, and the column to match against is named in the
registry. The batch and the `batch_column` it was matched against are both
recorded in the `run_header` log line. That matters more here than for
`--limit`: a scoped run uploads a fraction of the ready rows and looks, in
every other field of that record, exactly like a run that found little to do.

## A run may not exceed Internet Archive's daily item cap

*Decided 2026-08-23.*

`.claude/CLAUDE.md` states IA's limits as "500 items per upload run,
5000/day". `CHUNK_SIZE` covered the per-run half from the beginning. Nothing
covered the daily half on either path: a bare `upload --live` on a fully
catalogued Sheet planned every ready row, and the only thing between it and a
throttled half-finished batch was rate-limit detection that has never been
observed against a live response.

Both paths now refuse a run over `DAILY_ITEM_CAP` and name the fix. Three
choices went into that:

- **Refuse rather than silently cap.** Defaulting `--limit` to 5,000 would
  make an over-cap run stop short and still report cleanly, which reads as a
  complete run. That is the same trap the `--limit <= 0` guard already exists
  to avoid.
- **Check after the `--limit` slice.** A Sheet holding more ready rows than
  the cap is not itself an error; running at all of them in one day is. So
  `--limit` is the ordinary way through, not a special case.
- **An explicit override, not none at all.** The cap is IA's, not ours, and an
  account whose cap has been raised is a real case — but it has to be stated.
  `--allow-over-daily-cap` is deliberately verbose enough not to be passed by
  reflex.

It applies in test mode too. A rehearsal uploads to `test_collection` through
the same account and spends the same quota.

## Rate-limit detection uses a parsed status code, never message text

*Decided 2026-08-22. Revised 2026-08-22 after review found the first version
could false-positive.*

`is_rate_limit_error()` looks **only** at a parsed status-code integer,
never at `str(exc)` or any server-supplied text. The first version of this
function scanned `str(exc)` for `"status 429"`/`"status 503"` substrings;
review found that unsafe in both directions and it was replaced, not merely
tightened:

- a 404 (or anything else) whose body happens to mention `"status 503"` — a
  mirrored error, a proxied message, an echoed request — misclassified as a
  rate limit and would have wrongly stopped the whole run.
- a plain substring test also matches `"status 5031"` or `"status 42900"` —
  digits that merely *contain* 503/429, not equal to them.

A false positive here is worse than a miss: it halts a batch mid-flight, on
a command that creates permanent items, for a reason that is not real. The
replacement checks two structured sources, both verified by reading source
rather than guessed:

1. **`UploadFailed.status_code`** — a new exception (subclassing
   `RuntimeError`, so the pre-existing `pytest.raises(RuntimeError, ...)`
   caller keeps working) that `upload_row()` raises in place of a bare
   `RuntimeError`, carrying the real, parsed `response.status_code` as a
   structured attribute rather than only embedding it in the message text.
2. **`exc.response.status_code`** —
   `requests.exceptions.RequestException.__init__` (the base of
   `HTTPError`) stores whatever `Response` it is given as `.response`
   (`self.response = kwargs.pop("response", None)`, confirmed by reading
   `requests`' own source, not assumed). Tracing the installed
   `internetarchive` 5.10.1's `Item.upload_file()` — the method
   `upload_row()` actually reaches via `internetarchive.upload()` — shows
   that on a real S3 failure it catches the resulting `HTTPError` and
   re-raises via
   `raise type(exc)(error_msg, response=exc.response, request=exc.request)`.
   The **message** there is rebuilt from the S3 XML body's `Message`/
   `Resource` elements (`get_s3_xml_text()` in `internetarchive/utils.py`)
   and loses the numeric status and the S3 error `Code` (e.g. `SlowDown`)
   entirely — but `response=exc.response` is passed through **unchanged**,
   so `.response.status_code` still holds the real, original status even
   though the text does not.

That second finding reverses what the first version of this decision said:
a live rate limit surfacing through the real library's own exception *is*
catchable, just not by reading its message — it has to be read from the
structured `.response.status_code` the library itself preserves. There is
no text-based fallback: neither exception this codebase's upload path can
raise lacks a structured status (see both sources above), so the rate-limit
decision never depends on server-supplied text at all.

*Amended 2026-09-02:* that last claim had one hole — the metadata GET inside
`internetarchive.upload()`, whose status the library stripped before it
reached `is_rate_limit_error()`. Closed structurally rather than by relaxing
the rule; see
["A status the metadata call strips is recovered, still without reading text"](#a-status-the-metadata-call-strips-is-recovered-still-without-reading-text).

503 is Internet Archive's documented S3 overload signal (the installed
`internetarchive` 5.10.1's own `ia upload --retries` help text: *"Number of
times to retry request if S3 returns a 503 SlowDown error"*); 429 is not
IA-upload-specific documentation, but `session.py`'s default urllib3 `Retry`
`status_forcelist` (`[429, 500, 501, 502, 503, 504]`) shows the library's own
authors also treat it as rate-limit-adjacent.

No `--live` run has ever happened, so no real rate-limit response has ever
been captured. *Amended 2026-09-02:* source-reading is no longer the only
evidence for the second source — a fault-injecting transport adapter mounted
on `s3.us.archive.org` now drives the real `Item.upload_file()` and confirms
that an S3 failure really does re-raise `HTTPError` with its `Response`
attached, status intact, while the message loses it. What is still unverified
is IA's own behavior: that a real rate limit arrives as one of these shapes at
all. A missed
detection (an exception with neither attribute, or a genuinely different
status) is the safe failure direction: the row is logged as one ordinary
failure and the run continues, same as any other transient error, whereas a
false match aborts a run mid-flight over an unrelated error. `--limit`
(above) remains the operator-controlled fallback either way.

## Retry covers transport failures, never refusals

*Decided 2026-09-02, closing issue #5.*

A transient failure talking to archive.org used to fail that row for the
whole run — observed as a `ReadTimeout` on `archive.org/metadata/...` with
nothing wrong with the data, the Sheet or the file. Across ~10,000 items, at
least one such failure is close to certain, and the recovery was correct but
manual: the row was never marked done, so the operator re-ran to chase a
flake a retry would have absorbed.

`retry_ia_call()` now wraps the network call inside `upload_row()` and
`update_metadata_row()`. Both run loops — the Sheet path's `SheetUploadRun`
and the CSV path's `run_rows()` — get it without knowing it exists.

**The gap this actually closes is the S3 transfer, not the metadata read.**
Reading the installed `internetarchive` 5.10.1's source rather than assuming:
`ArchiveSession.__init__` mounts a retrying adapter — urllib3
`Retry(total=3, connect=3, read=3, backoff_factor=1)` — but **only on
`archive.org`**, and deliberately not on the S3 host (`session.py`: *"Don't
mount on s3.us.archive.org, only archive.org! IA-S3 requires a more
complicated retry workflow"*). So metadata reads and `modify_metadata` POSTs
already had three transport attempts, and the timeout in the issue is what a
run looks like *after* those. The file transfer — the slowest call this tool
makes, minutes long for a 10 MB photograph on a domestic link — had none.
`Item.upload_file()`'s own `retries` argument would not have closed it
either: it defaults to `retries or 0` and only ever fires on a 503.

**What is retryable is decided by a parsed status, never by message text** —
the same rule, through the same `parsed_status_code()` helper, that
["Rate-limit detection uses a parsed status code, never message text"](#rate-limit-detection-uses-a-parsed-status-code-never-message-text)
established:

| Failure | Retried | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ConnectionError`, `Timeout` (incl. `ReadTimeout`) | yes | No response completed; nothing says the next attempt fails too |
| 500, 502, 504 | yes | Server-side and not a refusal of *this* request |
| **429, 503** | **no** | Already answered by something stronger — see below |
| 403, 400, 404, any other 4xx | no | A refusal is repeatable; retrying only lengthens the walk to the same answer |
| `ValueError`, `RuntimeError`, `MetadataUnchanged`, anything unrecognized | no | This file's own guards, and a bug is not made truer by a second attempt |

**429 and 503 are deliberately excluded.** They are Internet Archive saying
"slow down", and this tool already answers that with more than a retry:
`is_rate_limit_error()` stops the whole run after the current chunk's confirm
write so the operator resumes tomorrow. Retrying them here would delay that
stop for every rate-limited row while making the overload marginally worse.
The alternative — a short backoff before falling through to the stop, which
is what `ia upload --retries` does — was considered and rejected as
re-litigating a decision already made and documented.

Three attempts, with **equal jitter**: half of a ceiling that doubles each
time (2s, then 4s, capped at 30s), plus a random share of the other half.
The randomness matters because a chunk's rows fail in lockstep when
archive.org is briefly unwell and a fixed backoff would send them all back at
the same instant; the fixed half matters because full jitter can draw a delay
near zero, and a wait that does not wait cannot outlast the slowdown it
exists for. Three rather than more because a row that fails all three is
logged as an ordinary failure and picked up by the next run — re-running is
already the supported recovery, and a failed attempt never burns an
identifier.

**Retrying is safe for both wrapped calls.** `upload_row()` passes
`checksum=True`, so Internet Archive skips a file whose MD5 already matches
the item's: a retry after a timeout that had in fact landed re-sends nothing
and creates no duplicate. A metadata update is a full statement of the fields
to set, not an increment, so applying it twice lands where applying it once
does. In neither case can a retry mint a second identifier — the target is
chosen before the retried function is reached.

The final attempt's exception is re-raised **unchanged**, not wrapped: every
caller's `except Exception` branch logs `str(exc)` and hands the object to
`is_rate_limit_error()`, so wrapping would both change what the log records
and hide the parsed status the run-stopping decision reads.

`fetch_current_metadata()` is deliberately **not** wrapped. It already sits
behind the library's three retries, it already returns `None` rather than
raising so that a dry run which cannot reach one item still reports the other
9,999, and retrying it would make a 10,000-row dry run crawl.

**A `Retry-After` header is honoured, but bounded.** urllib3 sleeps the
requested duration with no ceiling — `Retry.sleep_for_retry()` calls
`time.sleep(retry_after)` directly, and `DEFAULT_BACKOFF_MAX` (120s) bounds
only the exponential path. A `Retry-After: 3600` on a 503 would therefore
sleep an hour inside one call, three times over, and the operator would see a
run that had simply stopped producing output. `BoundedRetryAfter` caps it at
`RETRY_AFTER_MAX_SECONDS` (30s). Ignoring the header outright would be worse —
it is the server saying exactly what it wants — but this tool already has a
better answer than waiting out a long one: a 429/503 stops the run so the
operator resumes tomorrow. Anything longer than the bound becomes "stop the
run" rather than "sleep through the afternoon".

That is a subclass rather than urllib3's own `retry_after_max=` argument,
which exists only in very recent urllib3 (absent through at least 2.6.0);
pinning that tightly would constrain an environment whose urllib3 arrives as
a transitive dependency of `requests`. urllib3 counts retries down by calling
`increment()`, which rebuilds through `new()` as `type(self)(...)`, so the
subclass — and the bound — survive every retry rather than applying only to
the first. A test pins that, because a bound that silently vanished on the
first retry would be a bound in name only.

**The S3 leg is exercised, not just reasoned about.** `s3.us.archive.org` is
hardcoded in `item.py`, so a local server cannot stand in for it — but a
`requests` transport adapter mounted on that host can. The tests mount a
canned metadata adapter on `archive.org` (so the upload actually reaches S3
rather than failing before it) and a fault-injecting adapter on
`s3.us.archive.org`, then run the real `upload_row()` through the real
`Item.upload_file()`. This confirms by behavior what the decision above
established by reading source: a real S3 failure re-raises `HTTPError` with
`response=exc.response` passed through, so the parsed status survives even
though the rebuilt message has lost it. One test asserts `"503" not in
str(exc)` precisely to prove the classifier is not quietly succeeding by
reading text.

There is no `--retries` flag. The constants are `RETRY_ATTEMPTS`,
`RETRY_BASE_SECONDS`, `RETRY_MAX_SECONDS` and `RETRY_AFTER_MAX_SECONDS` in
`ia_bulk.py`; a flag can be added if a real run on the LCPS link wants one.

**What none of this verifies.** Every probe and test above stands in for
Internet Archive; none of them *is* Internet Archive. What is now established
is how `internetarchive` 5.10.1 and urllib3 behave for a given response —
which is a property of those libraries, not of IA. What remains unverified is
whether IA's real responses take the shapes assumed: whether the daily cap
surfaces as 429/503 at all rather than a 403 or a 200 with an error body,
whether a real `SlowDown` carries a `Retry-After`, and how a genuinely slow
multi-megabyte transfer behaves. No `--live` run has ever happened. Those
answers only arrive with real traffic.

## A status the metadata call strips is recovered, still without reading text

*Decided 2026-09-02, alongside the retry work above.*

`internetarchive.upload()` reads an item's metadata before transferring
anything, so a rate limit can surface from that GET rather than from S3. But
`session.get_metadata()` catches every failure and re-raises
`type(exc)(error_msg)` — a fresh exception of the same class, built from the
message alone — which drops `.response`, the only structured status
[the rule above](#rate-limit-detection-uses-a-parsed-status-code-never-message-text)
allows us to read. A 503 there was invisible: logged as one ordinary failure
while the run ground on through the rest of the chunk repeating it.

Probing a local server that answers real status codes, rather than reasoning
about the library, showed the gap was **wider than a lost `.response`**:

| Status | What reached `ia_bulk` before | Status readable? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 429, 500, 503 | `requests.exceptions.RetryError` | no — no `Response` was ever produced |
| 400, 403, 404 | `requests.exceptions.HTTPError`, `.response is None` | no — stripped by the re-raise |

The 5xx row is the surprising one. Those statuses are in the adapter's
`status_forcelist`, so urllib3 retries them three times and then raises
`MaxRetryError`, which requests turns into a `RetryError`. No `Response`
object exists anywhere in that path, so no amount of unwrapping recovers a
status.

**Two changes, both structural, neither reading message text:**

1. **`IA_RETRY` sets `raise_on_status=False`** and is passed to
   `upload()`, `modify_metadata()` and `get_item()` via
   `http_adapter_kwargs`, which every one of them forwards to
   `get_session()`. urllib3 still makes the same three attempts against the
   same forcelist with the same backoff — only the give-up changes: the final
   `Response` is *returned* rather than raised through, so it meets
   `get_metadata()`'s own `raise_for_status()` and becomes an ordinary
   `HTTPError` carrying that response. Every other field of the policy is
   copied from `internetarchive` 5.10.1's `mount_http_adapter()`, and a test
   pins that equality against a session **the library itself builds**, so a
   future version changing its defaults fails loudly instead of silently
   altering what we retry.
2. **`parsed_status_code()` walks `exc.__context__`.** Python's implicit
   chaining still holds the *original* exception, `.response` intact, behind
   the stripped copy. The outermost status wins, so an exception raised while
   handling an older one reports its own failure. The walk is guarded against
   a cycle in `__context__` — an unguarded one would hang the run rather than
   fail a row.

Together these restore the invariant the decision above claims: every failure
this codebase's IA calls can raise now carries a status reachable without
touching `str(exc)`. Verified end to end through the real
`internetarchive.upload()` against a local server:

| Status | Rate limit | Retryable | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 503, 429 | yes | no | run stops after the chunk's confirm write |
| 500, 502 | no | yes | retry absorbs it |
| 403, 400, 404 | no | no | row fails immediately |

The alternative was parsing the status out of the message, which the library
*does* preserve in text. Rejected: it is exactly what the decision above
replaced, and the message interpolates a server-influenced URL. Recovering
the integer structurally costs a dozen lines and keeps one rule instead of
two.

`urllib3` becomes a direct dependency, declared in `requirements.txt`. It was
already installed as `requests`' own dependency; `Retry` is imported from
`urllib3.util.retry` — where `internetarchive`'s `session.py` gets it — rather
than through `requests.adapters`, which re-exports it without declaring it
public.

## Every recorded timestamp is UTC

*Decided 2026-08-23.*

`run_stamp()` already used `time.gmtime()`, and said why: local time repeats
an hour during the DST fall-back transition, so two rehearsals started an hour
apart across it would mint the same stamp. Exactly the same is true of the
values that outlive the run — the `ia_uploaded` cell, which is the permanent
record of when an archival item was published, and every line of the log that
`--resume-from` and any later audit read. Both were naive local time, with no
offset recorded to reconstruct the real instant from afterwards.

All of them now go through `utc_timestamp()`: ISO-8601 UTC with an explicit
`Z`. The `Z` is not decoration — without it the string is ambiguous, and the
ambiguity is only resolvable by knowing which machine wrote it and what its
clock was set to that day. `open_log()`'s filename stamp is UTC for the same
reason, so a directory listing sorts in the order the runs actually happened.

## "Unchanged" is a third outcome, not a failure

IA returns HTTP 400 with `{"error": "no changes to _meta.xml"}` when a
metadata
update matches what is already on the item. Nothing is wrong; there was just
nothing to do. Treating that as a failure would inflate the error count and
flip the exit code on a re-run of a correct CSV — which matters because
`sync-metadata` is meant to be safe to run repeatedly.

`update_metadata_row` detects that exact error string and raises
`MetadataUnchanged`, which `run_rows` counts and logs in its own bucket.
