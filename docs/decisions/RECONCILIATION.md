# Reconciliation

How `reconcile-files` matches a Sheet's filename cell against what is
actually on disk, and why every match it finds stays a proposal until a
human accepts it.

One of the decision records indexed by
[`../DECISIONS.md`](../DECISIONS.md). Section titles here are cited verbatim
from code comments, so they are stable — if you rename one, grep for it
first.

## A correction is proposed, never applied

*Decided 2026-08-23, designing `propose_match()`.*

`propose_match()` returns a `Proposal` or `None` — it never writes to a row
itself, and it never guesses between two plausible answers. When either of
its passes turns up more than one candidate it raises `AmbiguousMatch`,
naming every match, instead of picking one. That is the same rule
`resolve_file()` already follows for the rest of this pipeline: "two files
sharing a stem is an error naming both, never a pick" — see
`FILES-AND-METADATA.md`, "A file is found by resolution, not by
constructing a path". An identifier is permanent once minted, so choosing
between two named files on the operator's behalf is the kind of silent
decision this project refuses everywhere it comes up — reconciliation is
just the newest place that rule applies.

`cmd_reconcile_files` keeps the same shape one level up. A proposal only
ever reaches the Sheet after `prompt_for_decision()` returns
`Decision(action="accept", ...)` — typed by a human at `[y]` or `[e]`.
`--dry-run` makes the boundary visible: it counts the proposals a real run
would ask about (`-v` prints each one) and writes nothing at all, so "would
propose" and "did apply" are never the same event even by accident.

## Pass B requires identical digit sequences

*Decided 2026-08-23, after noticing that one of the real source folders
numbers its files instead of naming them.*

`SOP CD 2 COE`'s files are `001_seaside_beach.JPG`,
`002_westport_tunnel_by_Ford.JPG`, and so on — sequential numbers, not
descriptive names. That numbering is what makes edit distance dangerous
here: two files that share every character except one digit —
`001_seaside_beach.JPG` and a hypothetical `002_seaside_beach.JPG` — are
one Levenshtein edit apart, exactly the same distance as a genuine typo.
Edit distance alone cannot tell "the same photograph with a mangled name"
from "an entirely different, adjacently numbered photograph", and
confidently proposing the wrong one is worse than proposing nothing,
because a wrong filename resolves cleanly and never gets a second look.

`digit_runs()` pulls every run of digits out of a normalized name, in
order. Pass B only considers a candidate whose digit runs match the wanted
name's exactly; letters may differ within the edit-distance budget, numbers
may not. That keeps `finnis`/`finnish` (identical digits, letters one edit
apart) matchable while refusing `001_seaside_beach`/`002_seaside_beach`
(different digits) outright, however close their edit distance.

## Accents are folded, not deleted

*Decided 2026-08-23, after a review measured what `normalize_name()` did to
Nordic names.*

`normalize_name()` replaces every run of characters outside `[a-z0-9]` with
a single space, which is what makes ` Roy_s  Shell` and `Roy's Shell`
compare equal. An accented character is outside that set too, so it was
being deleted along with the punctuation — and that is not a graceful
degradation, it is a wrong answer stated confidently. Two distinct names
differing only in which vowels carry diaereses collapsed to the same
skeleton and came back as a Pass A match, the tool's *most* certain
register, for two different photographs; a stem written entirely in
accented characters collapsed to nothing at all, which is within the edit
budget of every short name in the folder. This is an Astoria
Finnish/Scandinavian collection — the sample drive already holds a "Finnish
Meat Market" — so neither case is hypothetical.

The names are now NFKD-decomposed and their combining marks dropped before
the substitution runs, so an accented vowel becomes its base letter rather
than a gap. That also promotes real matches: an accented name against its
unaccented transcription used to be a distance-2 guess and is now an exact
match after normalization. `propose_match()` refuses outright when the
normalized target is empty, and skips any candidate whose own normalized
stem is empty, so neither side of the comparison can be built out of
nothing. Letters that carry no combining mark to drop — `ø` and `æ` — still
degrade to a gap; that leaves them a short edit away from their base
spelling, which proposes correctly, rather than colliding with anything.

## A typed filename is resolved, not trusted

*Decided 2026-08-23, designing the `[e]` prompt key.*

An operator can type a filename directly instead of accepting a proposal or
leaving a row alone. That path is not a bare write to the Sheet — the typed
string goes through the same `resolve_file()` every other path in this tool
uses. A name that does not resolve to exactly one real file in the row's
folder is refused with `resolve_file()`'s own error and asked again; a name
that resolves to a file another row in this run already claimed is
refused too, with a message saying the file is already used by another
row (not which one — `claimed` is a set of paths, with no row number
attached to remember).

The reason is structural, not extra caution. `reconcile-files` exists to
fix rows where what a human typed does not match what is on disk — a prompt
that trusted a second human-typed string without checking it would reopen
exactly that defect, one keystroke removed. Routing it through
`resolve_file()` also makes typing more forgiving than it looks: a name
typed without its extension, or in the wrong case, still resolves, the same
way it would anywhere else in this tool — see `FILES-AND-METADATA.md`,
"A file is found by resolution, not by constructing a path".

## Reconciliation ships before append

*Decided 2026-08-23, scoping this work away from a second, deferred piece
of the same request: appending a new Sheet row for a photo file that has no
row at all.*

To the tool, "this file has no row" and "this file has a row with a
misspelled name" look identical — both are simply a file left in
`unclaimed`. An append step run first could not tell those cases apart, so
it would add a brand-new row for a photograph that already has one, leaving
the original, misspelled row still sitting on the Sheet. That is a
duplicate row for the same photograph, once for every unresolved row —
exactly the kind of misattribution this tool refuses to introduce anywhere
else.

Reconciliation has to run — and converge, fixing or explicitly leaving
alone as much as an operator will decide in one sitting — before an append
step can trust what remains unclaimed as genuinely orphaned files rather
than "orphaned, or maybe just misspelled". The ordering also happens to be
free: reconciliation only ever edits a cell that already exists on a row
that already exists, so nothing about it depends on append existing yet, or
ever.

## Append's gate is hard, with no override flag

*Decided 2026-08-27, when the deferred append step above was built as
`append-rows`.*

The ordering the previous section argues for is enforced by the tool, not
left as advice: `append-rows` refuses outright while any row names a file
that does not resolve. "Explicitly leaving alone" a row at reconcile's
`[n]` prompt therefore does not clear the way — the row still asserts a
filename the drive contradicts, and its intended file still sits in
`unclaimed` where append would give it a second row. The operator's
remedies are the honest ones: fix the cell (at `[y]`/`[e]`, or by hand),
or blank it, which reclassifies the row as not-yet-catalogued — a row
that asserts no file cannot be hiding a typo, so blank rows never block
append.

No `--force`-style override exists on purpose. The failure it would
permit is a duplicate row for a photograph, which mints a second permanent
identifier for one image at upload time — the exact misattribution the
rest of this tool refuses everywhere else. An override that is ever safe
to use is one the guard should have allowed; one that is never safe to
use is one the flag should not offer.

Two smaller decisions ride along. A structurally shifted data row —
which `reconcile-files` merely skips — is *fatal* to append: reconcile's
operator approves rows one at a time, so one suspect row only costs that
row, but append trusts the whole survey at once, and a misread row can
make the file it really means look unclaimed. And append writes only the
`file_template` columns, padded to the header's width by column index:
every other cell is the cataloguer's, because this step removes the
transcription work, never the cataloguing work.

## Exit code is 0 while work remains

*Decided 2026-08-23, reapplying an existing judgment about `validate` and
`upload` to a third command — see below.*

`reconcile-files` returns `0` even when rows remain unresolved at the end
of a run — a rejected proposal, a row left for later, or a `[q]` stop
partway through a large backlog are not failures, they are exactly what an
operator working a ~10,000-row collection over many sessions looks like.
The run still reports the count ("N row(s) still unresolved"); it just is
not what decides the exit code.

Only a run that could not do its job at all returns `1` — `read_sheet()`
never even reached the rows (the Sheet's ID is still the registry's
placeholder, the spreadsheet couldn't be read at all, or it had no data
rows), the Sheet's header row carries a defect that corrupts every row
alike (two columns normalizing to one IA field name, or one normalizing to
nothing), the Sheet has no column matching `file_template`'s name field, or
a write to it fails outright. Every one of those is a reason nothing here
can work around the problem, not that a row turned out to be broken — a
defect in one *data* row (a row longer than the header, whose cells may all
be shifted against it) is deliberately not in that list: that row alone is
skipped, named on screen, and the rest of the run proceeds. A
non-zero exit that persists for the weeks this backlog will realistically
take to clear teaches the operator to stop reading it — the same trap
`READINESS.md`'s "A bad row is skipped; a bad
header stops the whole run" already rejects for `validate` and `upload`,
reapplied here rather than relearned.
