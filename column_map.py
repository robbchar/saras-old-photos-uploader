    `name + ".jpg"` would produce `Liberty.jpg.jpg` for the 9 and can't be
    trusted to be right for the other 225 (some are TIFF masters). See
    docs/DECISIONS.md, "A file is found by resolution, not by constructing
    a path".

    `candidate` is split at its last "/" into a directory part and a name
    part. A "/" present with nothing before it (an empty folder segment -
    e.g. a blank cell in file_template's folder column) is refused outright
    rather than treated as "search files_dir's own root": that silently
    turns a missing required cell into a search of the wrong place instead
    of a failure. `files_dir` is a hard boundary, not just a starting
    point - the folder part is resolved and checked to still be under it,
    so an absolute path or a `..` pasted into a Sheet cell cannot escape it
    (`Path(files_dir) / part` would otherwise silently discard `files_dir`
    entirely when `part` is itself absolute).

    Within the resolved directory, matching happens in three passes, each
    one only tried if the previous found nothing:
    1. An exact, case-sensitive filename match (handles the 9 real rows
       that already carry an extension).
    2. A file whose own extension-stripped stem equals the FULL name part,
       case-insensitively, without touching the name part itself - this is
       what lets a name that legitimately contains a dot which isn't an
       extension (an archival reference like "Report.1958") still match
       "Report.1958.tif" instead of being chopped down to "Report" and
       silently matching an unrelated "Report.jpg".
    3. The same comparison but with the name part's OWN trailing segment
       also chopped as if it were an extension - this is the fallback that
       handles the Sheet cell already carrying a real extension in a
       different case than disk (e.g. ".jpg" in the cell, ".JPEG" on disk).
    Zero matches (after all three passes) or more than one at any pass both
    raise FileResolutionError rather than guess - two files sharing a stem
    (a JPEG and a TIFF master, say) is exactly the case an operator must
    resolve by hand, never automatically.

    `listing_cache` maps a resolved directory to its file listing, built at
    most once per directory - the real Sheet is 234 rows across 5 folders,
    and the full collection is ~10,000 rows across a similar handful, so
