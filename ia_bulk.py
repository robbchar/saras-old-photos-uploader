# REQUIRED_UPLOAD_COLUMNS, and do not add "identifier" back either.
#
# "identifier": on the Sheet path this is ordinary donor metadata (the
# real Sheet's own `Identifier` column holds an archival reference like
# "CD 1 01 53 58 1 Central SS"), not the tool's minted identifier - that
# lives in `ia_identifier`, which is never required here either: a blank
# ia_identifier is the normal starting state for every new row
# (RowState.UNASSIGNED), not an error. See docs/DECISIONS.md, "Tool-owned
# Sheet columns are all `ia_`-prefixed".
#
# "file" is left out entirely, not merely reclassified. By the time
# validate_rows sees a Sheet row, cmd_validate has already turned
# `file_template` plus the row's own columns into a candidate path and
# resolved it against `files_dir` (see resolve_file() in column_map.py),
# recording the outcome in a FileOutcomes: resolved (a real, disk-verified
# `file` value), blank (nobody named a file yet - a readiness fact), or
# broken (a name was given and didn't resolve - an error, via
# outcomes.errors). A required-columns check for `file` here would just
# be a second, cruder way of asking the same question FileOutcomes already
# answered precisely, producing a duplicate "missing required column
# 'file'" line behind the resolver's own, more actionable message. See
# docs/DECISIONS.md, "A file is found by resolution, not by constructing a
# path".
#
# "title" is also gone, but reclassified rather than dropped: it moved to
# the registry's required_for_upload (see ProjectConfig), because it is
# ordinary human-filled metadata - a blank title means "nobody has
# catalogued this row yet" (readiness), not "this row is broken"
# (validity). `required_columns` here is now reserved for what is
# structurally guaranteed to exist independent of any human filling
# anything in.
#
# NOT to be confused with validate_rows' check_file_exists / is_file()
# check below, a completely different mechanism that stays untouched: it

    prior run already validated and uploaded successfully - the identifier
    is still tracked for duplicate detection, just without redoing the
    regex/registry/disk-stat checks.

    required_columns defaults to REQUIRED_UPLOAD_COLUMNS (the CSV path,
    unchanged) but the Sheet path passes SHEET_REQUIRED_COLUMNS, which
    excludes 'identifier' - see that constant's comment for why.

    check_file_exists defaults to True (the CSV path, unchanged: a CSV row's
    'file' is a real, already-resolvable path, so checking it on disk is
    correct there). The Sheet path now also passes True (Phase 2 - see
    SHEET_REQUIRED_COLUMNS' comment): by the time this runs, cmd_validate
    has already resolved each row's 'file' against disk via resolve_file(),
    so this check is a redundant safety net there rather than the primary
    signal, which is fine - it costs one cheap is_file() stat per row.

    identifier_column defaults to "identifier" (the CSV path, unchanged:
    that column is pre-assigned, permanent, and never generated by this

    Sheet's own 'identifier' column holds the donor's original archival

    reason - which is exactly what happened against the real Sheet before
    this fix. See docs/DECISIONS.md, "Tool-owned Sheet columns are all
    `ia_`-prefixed".

    required_for_upload defaults to () (the CSV path, unchanged: a CSV's
    'title' etc. are already covered by required_columns, and a CSV has no
    ProjectConfig to source a second list from). The Sheet path passes
    config.required_for_upload - a blank one of these is a READINESS fact

    There are two different reasons a column does not ship, and collapsing
    them into one list would recreate that same untruth in a quieter form:

    - `identifier` and `file` are dropped outright (DROPPED_BY_UPLOAD_ROW):
      one is Internet Archive's own item identifier, the other a local path.
    - `mediatype` and `collection` ARE sent, but with a value this tool
      generates - upload_from_sheet overwrites row['mediatype'] from the
      registry and upload_row sets metadata['collection'] unconditionally, so
      a Sheet column of either name has its own value silently discarded.
      ia_fields.PIPELINE_OWNED_FIELDS is the existing definition of that set,
      reused here rather than restated, so the receipt and the
      rename-suggestion logic cannot disagree about which names are the
      tool's."""

    which are not aligned with `rows` at all. Passing a mismatched list
    would make zip() silently truncate to the shorter one rather than
    raising, so a caller-side wiring mistake would produce plausible-looking
    but wrong counts instead of an obvious failure - which is exactly the
    kind of silent wrongness this function exists to prevent, so the length
    is checked explicitly instead.

    Counts are cross-referenced against row_results rather than
    classify_row() alone, for EVERY bucket, not just "ready": a row that
    classify_row() would call DONE or RESERVED but that actually fails
    validation (a duplicate identifier, an unregistered project prefix, a
    now-missing title) is not "already uploaded" or "will retry" just
    because it has the shape of one - RESERVED in particular makes a
    forward-looking promise ("will retry under existing identifier") that a
    row failing identifier validation cannot keep.

    Validity itself splits three ways, not two: a row is either READY
    (catalogued and passes validation), invalid (catalogued but fails
    validation), or NOT_READY (missing one or more required_for_upload/
    file_template fields - see RowValidation.readiness). Crossed with
    classify_row()'s three states that makes nine buckets, not six. A row
    that is BOTH not-ready and carrying validation errors (e.g. an
    uncatalogued row whose filename is also a typo) is counted ONCE, under
    not-ready: not-ready takes precedence over invalid, because "nobody has
    filled this in yet" is the more useful thing to tell an operator than a
    validation error that will most likely resolve itself the moment the
    row is catalogued. Every row falls into exactly one of UNASSIGNED/DONE/
    RESERVED and then exactly one of ready/invalid/not_ready, so the nine
    counts below always sum to len(rows).

    Only non-zero buckets render, except the three per-state headline lines
    ("ready to upload"/"already uploaded"/"reserved but unconfirmed"), which
    always print - even as "0" - so the three lifecycle states themselves
    are never silently absent from the report. When both a state's
    not_ready and invalid counts are non-zero, not_ready prints first: it is
    normally the far larger of the two (an unfilled-in row rather than a
    broken one) and is not an error, so it reads before the more alarming

    Takes a SUBSET of a run's results - the not-ready rows of one lifecycle
    state - and is called once per such state by format_lifecycle_summary,
    rather than once for the whole report. It used to render a standalone
    block below the summary, headed by its own "N rows not yet catalogued"
    total. That header was the sum across the three lifecycle states that can
    hold a not-ready row, but on the ordinary Sheet only one of them is
    non-zero, so it read as a verbatim repeat of the line just above it. See
    docs/decisions/READINESS.md, "The missing-field detail belongs to the
    count above it".

    Splitting per state is not merely tidier: an uncatalogued row and a row
    whose title was cleared AFTER it uploaded need different work, and one
    merged "2 missing title" would hide that.

    This is also the measurement that sizes a planned follow-up tool - a
    script that fills filenames in from disk. If most not-ready rows are
    missing only a filename, that script closes most of the gap; if most are
    missing a title, it barely helps. Since the split, that reading is per

    the other two states are almost always empty.

    require before a row could go out" - the exact question that gets asked
    months later, once an identifier is already permanent and the Sheet has
    moved on and no longer shows what it looked like at upload time.

    `columns` and `held_back` come straight from the ColumnMap: `columns`
    maps EVERY header the Sheet had that run (not only the uploaded ones) to
    its normalized field name, and `held_back` names which of those were
    excluded as `(LCPS Internal)` - a receipt has to show what was left out,
    not only what went through. `required_for_upload` is the project's
    readiness rule at the time of the run: which normalized columns had to be
    non-blank for a row to be in scope at all. All three can change between
    runs (the Sheet gaining a column, a registry edit) even though none of
    them changes per row within one run, which is why this is written once
    per log rather than being documented once somewhere else.

    `limit` and `chunk_size` (Task 12) round out the same reconstructability
    goal: a run that stopped after --limit rows, or that used a non-default
    --chunk-size, cannot be explained later by the rest of this record alone.
    Both default to "the run's own default" (None / CHUNK_SIZE) so the three
    tests that call this directly without passing them still get a header
    that says so explicitly, rather than omitting the fields.

    `batch` is there for the same reason and is the strongest case of the
    three: a scoped run uploads a fraction of the ready rows and looks, in
    every other field of this record, exactly like a run that found little to
    do. `batch_column` is written beside it even on an unscoped run, since
    the value alone means nothing without the column it was matched against -
    and that column can change in the registry between runs.

    `collection` and `sheet_id` both name what the run actually used, not
    what the registry configures - a test run targets TEST_COLLECTION and the
    test Sheet, and a receipt that named the real ones would describe a run
    that never happened.

    Deliberately excludes anything that isn't safe to keep around in a log
    file indefinitely: no credentials, no tokens, no filesystem paths outside
    the project. `sheet_id` is the one Google identifier here, and it already

    different questions of the same records. The mode filter is load-bearing
    for both: a test-mode entry only ever confirms that the zztest-prefixed
    item landed in test_collection, never the real one, so it must not answer
    for a --live run (or vice versa). Logs from before the "live" field
    existed have no mode recorded and are treated conservatively as matching
    neither.

    A line that will not parse is SKIPPED, not raised on. log_result appends
    one line per row with no atomic write, so a run killed mid-write - Ctrl-C,
    a full disk, a closed laptop - leaves a truncated final line. Raising
    there made the log permanently unusable, disabling the only recovery
    mechanism the CSV path has using the exact crash it exists to recover
    from. Every intact line before the damaged one is still a real record and
    is still honored.

    Damaged lines are counted and reported on stderr rather than skipped in
    silence: a lost line is a row this run no longer knows anything about, and
    the operator should know why the run does not match the last one."""

# - a 404 (or anything else) whose body happens to mention "status 503" -
#   a mirrored error, a proxied message, an echoed request - would
#   misclassify as a rate limit and wrongly stop the whole run.
# - a plain substring test also matches "status 5031" or "status 42900":
#   digits that merely CONTAIN 503/429 as a substring, not equal to them.
#
# A false positive here is worse than a miss: it halts a batch mid-flight,
# on a command that creates permanent items, for a reason that is not real.
#
# Two structured sources are checked instead, both verified by reading
# source rather than guessed:
#
# 1. UploadFailed.status_code - set by upload_row() below, in this file,
#    from the real, parsed `response.status_code` whenever
#    internetarchive.upload() returns a not-ok Response. See UploadFailed's
#    own docstring.
#
# 2. exc.response.status_code - requests.exceptions.RequestException (the
#    base of HTTPError) stores whatever Response object it is given as
#    `.response` in its own __init__ (`self.response = kwargs.pop
#    ("response", None)` - verified by reading requests' source directly,
#    not assumed). Tracing the installed internetarchive 5.10.1's
#    Item.upload_file() - the method upload_row() actually reaches via
#    internetarchive.upload() -> Item.upload() - shows that on a real S3
#    failure it catches the resulting HTTPError and re-raises via
#    `raise type(exc)(error_msg, response=exc.response, request=exc.request)`.
#    The MESSAGE there is rebuilt from the S3 XML body's <Message>/
#    <Resource> text (see get_s3_xml_text() in internetarchive/utils.py) and
#    loses the numeric status and the S3 <Code> (e.g. "SlowDown") entirely -
#    but `response=exc.response` is passed through UNCHANGED, so
#    `.response.status_code` still holds the real, original status even
#    though the text does not. This is what lets the check below catch a
#    live rate limit surfacing through the real library's own exception,
#    not only upload_row()'s own not-ok-Response branch.
#
# 503 is Internet Archive's documented S3 overload signal (the installed
# internetarchive 5.10.1's own `ia upload --retries` help text: "Number of
# times to retry request if S3 returns a 503 SlowDown error"). 429 is not
# IA-upload-specific documentation, but session.py's default urllib3 Retry
# status_forcelist ([429, 500, 501, 502, 503, 504]) shows the library's own
# authors also treat it as rate-limit-adjacent.
#
# No --live run has ever happened, so no real rate-limit response has ever
# been captured - both sources above are verified against the installed
# library's SOURCE, not against actual IA behavior. Neither reachable
# exception in this codebase's own upload path lacks a structured status
# (see UploadFailed and the HTTPError tracing above), so there is no
# text-based fallback: the rate-limit decision never depends on
# server-supplied text, only on a parsed integer. A miss (an exception with
# neither attribute, or a genuinely different status) just logs one more
# ordinary failure and the run continues - --limit remains the
# operator-controlled backstop either way. See docs/DECISIONS.md,
# "Rate-limit detection uses a parsed status code, never message text".
#
# That "neither reachable exception" claim had one hole until 2026-09-02: the
# metadata GET inside internetarchive.upload(), whose status the library
# stripped before it ever reached here. Closed structurally - see IA_RETRY
# just below and the __context__ walk in parsed_status_code() - rather than by
# relaxing the no-message-text rule.
RATE_LIMIT_STATUS_CODES = (429, 503)

# internetarchive builds its own retrying HTTP adapter for archive.org, with
# urllib3's default `raise_on_status=True`. That default is why a rate limit
# on the metadata endpoint used to be invisible here. Verified against a local
# server answering real status codes, not reasoned about:
#
#   raise_on_status=True  (library default) - 429/500/503 exhaust urllib3's
#     three attempts and surface as requests.exceptions.RetryError. No
#     Response object is ever produced, so there is no status to read
#     anywhere, in the exception or its chain.
#   raise_on_status=False (this policy)     - the same three attempts happen,
#     but the final Response is RETURNED rather than raised through. It then
#     meets get_metadata()'s own resp.raise_for_status(), which produces a
#     normal HTTPError carrying that Response - and with it the real status.
#
# The retrying itself is unchanged: same total, same forcelist, same backoff.
# Only how the give-up is reported changes. Everything else is copied from
# internetarchive 5.10.1's session.mount_http_adapter() so that replacing the
# library's policy does not silently alter what it retries or how often - and
# a test pins that equality against a session the library builds itself, so
# a future version changing its defaults fails loudly rather than quietly.
# How long a server-supplied Retry-After may hold a single call.
#
# urllib3 honours Retry-After by sleeping the requested duration with no
# ceiling: Retry.sleep_for_retry() calls time.sleep(retry_after) directly, and
# DEFAULT_BACKOFF_MAX (120s) bounds only the exponential path, not this one.
# So `Retry-After: 3600` on a 503 would sleep an hour inside one call, three
# times over, and the operator would see a run that had simply stopped
# producing output.
#
# Ignoring the header entirely would be worse - it is the server telling us
# precisely what it wants. But this tool already has a better answer than
# waiting for a long one: a 429/503 stops the run so the operator resumes
# tomorrow. So the header is honoured up to this bound, and anything longer
# becomes "stop the run" rather than "sleep through the afternoon".

    outcomes: a row that named a file and was wrong (`errors`, carrying the
    resolver's own message), or a row that named nothing at all (`blank`,
    carrying which of file_template's cells are empty).

    Splitting the two here is the whole point. Below, on failure, the Sheet
    cell's raw, UNVERIFIED candidate must not survive as row['file'] - left in
    place it would coincidentally resolve as a literal path for the later disk
    check (or for an upload), silently masking the fact that resolution never
    actually confirmed this file exists. The cost of that blanking is that
    afterwards a row nobody filled in and a row with a typo'd filename are
    indistinguishable, both being row['file'] == "". This function is the last
    place the candidate still exists, so it is the only place the distinction
    can be drawn - and drawing it matters in one direction especially: a
    broken row misfiled as blank is downgraded from "fix me" to "nobody has
    got to it yet", which is how it stops ever being fixed.

    Shared by `validate` and `upload` deliberately: the value `upload` records
    in `ia_identifier_bib` has to be the same resolved name `validate` showed
    the operator, and two copies of this loop would eventually disagree.

    Rows resolving to the SAME file are all errors - every row in the group,
    not just the ones after the first, because the tool usually cannot know
    which row is the wrong one and flagging all but one silently elects a
    winner. The exception is a group holding exactly one row that has already
    uploaded: that row's identifier is permanent and its row is the only link
    between the identifier and its metadata, so it is named as the one to
    keep rather than offered for deletion alongside the others. Two
    rows claiming one photograph would mint two permanent identifiers for it,
    and - issue #1 - identical file_template cells are identical fingerprints,
    which is exactly when the mid-run-edit guard stops being able to tell the

    `stamp` is computed once by the caller (run_stamp(), called once per

    Row numbers are positional. A human inserting or deleting a row shifts
    every row below it, and the run holds row numbers from a read that may be
    hours old on a full-collection run - the initial read fixes them, and the
    last chunk's reserve write uses them. So this check runs before BOTH
    writes, not just before the confirm.

    Two things must agree. The fingerprint (the file_template columns, which
    this tool never writes) says the row still describes the same photograph.
    `ia_identifier` says nobody else has claimed it: blank for a row about to
    be reserved, and equal to ours once reserved. Checking the identifier alone
    would be tautological after reserve; checking the fingerprint alone would
    miss a row someone else assigned a number to in the meantime.

    And the fingerprint only proves anything while exactly one row in the
    fresh read carries it (issue #1). With two rows resolving to one file, a
    shift leaves a MATCHING fingerprint at the target's position with a
    different physical row underneath, and the write lands on the wrong row -
    misattributing the item and leaving the planned row to be minted again

    read, so a duplicated fingerprint here means one appeared mid-run; the
    target is filed as moved, the safe direction, and goes out on a rerun
    once the Sheet is untangled.

    That ambiguity check runs on the RESERVE leg only. After reserve, this
    run's own number is in the target's row and check_claimed_identifiers has
    already proved it unique across the whole Sheet, so the identifier
    comparison below is a complete proof of identity by itself: a shift puts a
    row that does NOT carry our number underneath. Vetoing a duplicated
    fingerprint there would withhold the confirm write for an edit that cannot

    scans: a number spent by any row in the Sheet is spent, whatever batch

    project_id is the run's own --project, required here for the same reason

    `ia_url` names, so a cell pointing at another project's item does not
    merely misfile this project's row - it overwrites that project's
    metadata. The --csv path gets this check from validate_identifiers; the
    Sheet path never runs that, so it is made here.

    Scope is RowState.DONE and nothing else. An UNASSIGNED row has no item to
    correct, and a RESERVED row's upload never confirmed - correcting metadata
    on an item that may not exist is a different problem, and `upload` already
    retries those under their existing identifier.

    Every DONE row is sent, not only rows that look changed. Internet Archive
    answers "no changes to _meta.xml" for an item that already matches, which
    update_metadata_row turns into MetadataUnchanged and the runner counts as
    `unchanged` rather than an error - so a full sync is idempotent by
    construction and needs no per-row change detection, no extra tool-owned
    column, and no second place for the Sheet and the item to drift apart.

    Blank cells are dropped by update_metadata_row, so a cleared cell means
    "leave this field alone" and REMOVE_TAG deletes - identical to the --csv
    path. A Sheet cell cleared by accident can therefore never strip metadata
    from a permanent public item.
