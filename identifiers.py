"""Minting the NUMBER half of an identifier, and reading a row's lifecycle
state from the Sheet's two tool-owned columns.

Identifiers are permanent once uploaded, so this module never reuses a number:
gaps left by a crashed run stay gaps. Identifiers are bounded by NUMBER_WIDTH (5 digits, max 99999);
exceeding this raises ValueError to prevent silent wrapping into duplicate identifiers.
See docs/DECISIONS.md, "Identifiers are minted by upload and written back to the Sheet"."""
